Tutorial:
Your pedal must be connected to a midi device. I personally use a Roland UM-One along with a MIDI Box One.
Read your pedal's manual for how to properly connect to midi.
Note: Blooper is currently not supported via just USB

Steps:
. Make sure you are using chrome.
. Make sure you are viewing the https version of the site.
. Make sure you allow midi when the chrome pop up appears, this setting can be set in site settings on chrome.
. Currently the page defaults to the UM-ONE, if you have a different device select it from the drop down and press the button.
. Hit some buttons twist some knobs and pray.
. If you have issues contact me and please list what hardware you are using and what you are seeing.

Note: Currently the app is sending midi commands to all channels on the device, this means if you have other pedals plugged in via midi some weird stuff might happen.
I don't so this was easier, but if it's annoying you reach out and I will make a change.

I would love to add more pedals and more features, for that I more pedals and more time.  I have no idea if people other than me have a use for this, so please reach out if you are enjoying it.
